# CoNoN
A Python package for LncRNA functional annoation through co-expression networks.

CoNoN (Co-expression Networks of Non-coding) is a Python package capable of identifying LncRNAs functions through co-expression networks.

From the identification of coding and non-coding genes, which can be previosly performed (for example, by RNAsamba), and from the expression matrix (CHIP-seq or RNA-Seq), the co-epression network is assembled. All CoNoN outputs are designed to be explored in Cytoscape.
